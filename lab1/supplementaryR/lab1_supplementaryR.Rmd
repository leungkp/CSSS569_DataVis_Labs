# \texttt{R} boot camp
- \texttt{R} is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics
  - *Object-oriented* style of programming
  - System-supplied or user-defined functionality as *functions*
  - Extended via *packages*

- \texttt{RStudio} is an integrated development environment for \texttt{R}, which includes:
  - a console to run \texttt{R} code
  - an editor to write code and text
  - tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management

- Let's open \texttt{RStudio} and a plain \texttt{R Script}

# Running \texttt{R} code and operators

\small
```{r}
# Arithmetic Operators
1 + 1 

2 * 8

9 / 3

2^3
```

# Running \texttt{R} code and operators

\small
```{r}
# Relational Operators
10 > 8

7 <= 6

(2 * 5) == 10

1 != 2
```

# Objects in \texttt{R}: vectors and assignment

\small
```{r}
# Concatenate vectors into a new vector
c(1, 2, 3)

# Assign them to a new object for manipulation
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
print(x) # or simply, x

# Operators on vector
x + 1

x == 1
```

# Objects in \texttt{R}: vectors and functions

\small
```{r}
# Use an object as input to a function
x <- c(1, 2, 3)

class(x)

length(x)

mean(x)
```

# Objects in \texttt{R}: three beginner tips
1. Unless you assign (`<-` ) some operations or transformations to an object, those chances will not be registered 

\small
```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
print(x + 1)
print(x)
x <- x + 1
print(x)
```

# Objects in \texttt{R}: three beginner tips
2. New assignment will overwrite the original values if you assign some values to an existing object. It is a **major** source of errors. One advise is to keep distinct object names

\small
```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
length(x)

x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
length(x)
```

# Objects in \texttt{R}: three beginner tips
3. When using functions, we often bump into unexpected outputs, or error messages:
  
\small
```{r}
y <- c(1, 2, 3, NA)
mean(y)

# It's essential to know how to seek help:
help(mean)
?mean

# Specify appropriate arguments for functions:
mean(y, na.rm = TRUE)
```

# Objects in \texttt{R}: atomic vectors
- What are vectors exactly?
   - (Atomic) vectors are the most basic units of data in \texttt{R}
   - Most common types of atomic vectors: **numeric (integer, double)**, **logical**, **character**

# Objects in \texttt{R}: atomic vectors
- Most common types of atomic vectors: **numeric (integer, double)**, **logical**, **character**

\small
```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
class(x)

y <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
class(y)

names <- c("Peter", "Paul", "Mary")
class(names)
```

# Objects in \texttt{R}: atomic vectors
- You can also coerce one type of vector into another: 

\small
```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
x <- as.character(x)

print(x)

class(x)
```

# Objects in \texttt{R}: matrix and data frame
- To deal with massive data, we need efficient data structures to store and manipulate vectors: **matrices** and **data frames**

# Objects in \texttt{R}: matrix and data frame
- To create a matrix:

\small
```{r}
# Create a vector
numbers <- 1:12
print(numbers)

# Store it as a matrix
matrix1 <- matrix(data = numbers, nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)
print(matrix1)
```

# Objects in \texttt{R}: matrix and data frame

\small
```{r}
# Basic information
class(matrix1)

dim(matrix1) # dimensions
```

# Objects in \texttt{R}: matrix and data frame

\small
```{r}
# We can change the row/column names of matrices
rownames(matrix1) 

rownames(matrix1) <- c("row1", "row2", "row3")
print(matrix1)
```

# Objects in \texttt{R}: matrix and data frame

\small
```{r}
# Automate any repetitive process
col_names <- paste0("column", 1:4)
print(col_names)

colnames(matrix1) <- col_names
print(matrix1)
```

# Objects in \texttt{R}: matrix and data frame

\small
```{r}
# To augment the matrix with new column
column5 <- c(13, 14, 15)
matrix1 <- cbind(matrix1, column5)
print(matrix1)
```

# Objects in \texttt{R}: matrix and data frame

\small
```{r}
# To augment the matrix with new row
row4 <- c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e")
matrix1 <- rbind(matrix1, row4)
print(matrix1)
```
Why do all vectors become characters? 

# Objects in \texttt{R}: matrix and data frame
- Matrices vs. data frames
   - Matrices can only contain one **homogenous** type of vectors
   - Data frames can contain **heterogeneous** types of vectors, and thus are more flexible

# Objects in \texttt{R}: matrix and data frame
- Data frames can contain **heterogeneous** types of vectors, and thus are more flexible

\small
```{r}
df1 <- data.frame(
  names = c("Peter", "Paul", "Mary"),
  age = c(14, 15, 16),
  female = c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

print(df1)
```

# Objects in \texttt{R}: matrix and data frame

\small
```{r}
# Basic information 
class(df1)

dim(df1)

str(df1)
```

# Objects in \texttt{R}: subsetting data 
- There are several ways to subset data: row/column indices, variable names, or evaluations

\small
```{r}
# 1) Subsetting by row/column indices
# For the element in row 1, column 1
df1[1, 1]

# For all elements in row 1, regardless of columns
df1[1, ]

# For all elements in column 1, regardless of rows
df1[, 1]
```

# Objects in \texttt{R}: subsetting data

\small
```{r}
# 2) Subsetting by variable names
df1$names
df1$age
df1$female
```

# Objects in \texttt{R}: subsetting data

\small
```{r}
# 3) Subsetting by evaluations
df1[df1$age >= 15, ]
df1[df1$female == TRUE, ]
df1[df1$name %in% c("Peter", "Paul"), ]
```

# Objects in \texttt{R}: creating new variable in data frame

\small
```{r}
print(df1)

df1$edu

df1$edu <- c("hs", "col", "phd")

print(df1)
```

# Summary of data structures in \texttt{R}

-----------------------------------------
     Homogeneous         Heterogeneous
---- ----------------   -----------------
1d    Atomic vector      List

2d    Matrix             Data frame

nd    Array
-----------------------------------------

- Another important data structure: \texttt{factor} for categorical data, which will be important for visualization purpose

# Vector practices
- Create the following objects:
1. vector1: {a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, b3, c1, c2, c3 ... z1, z2, z3}
    - Hint: break downs the question into two parts; check out function \texttt{rep(..., times = ..., each = ...)}

2. vector2: The sequence from 1 to 49 by an increment of 2
    - Hint: check out function \texttt{seq(...)}
    - Subset the 3rd, 16th, and 25th elements of the vector
    - Subset those elements whose values are either smaller than 10, or greater than 40

# Vector practices

\small
```{r}
# Q1
chr <- rep(letters, each = 3)
print(chr)
num <- rep(1:3, times = length(letters))
print(num)
```

# Vector practices

\small
```{r}
# Q1
vector1 <- paste0(chr, num)
print(vector1)
```

# Vector practices

\small
```{r}
# Q2
vector2 <- seq(from = 1, to = 49, by = 2)
print(vector2)
vector2[c(3, 16, 25)]
vector2[vector2 < 10 | vector2 > 40]
```

# Vector practices
3. matrix1: a 5 by 5 matrix containing values from vector2
    - Assign the row names: row_a, row_b, row_c, row_d, row_e
    - Assign the column names: col1, col2, col3, col4, col5
    - Multiply the values in the first column of matrix 1 by 100; overwrite the original column

4. df1: a dataframe with two variables:
    - country = {US, UK, CA, FR, IT}
    - pop = {327, 66, 37, 67, 60}
    - Subset top-three observations in term of the level of population
    - Hint: check out function \texttt{order(...)}
    
# Vector practices

\small
```{r}
# Q3
matrix1 <- matrix(data = vector2, nrow = 5, ncol = 5)
rownames(matrix1) <- paste("row", letters[1:5], sep = "_")
colnames(matrix1) <- paste0("col", 1:5)
matrix1[, 1] <- matrix1[, 1] * 100
print(matrix1)
```

# Vector practices

\scriptsize
```{r}
# Q4
df1 <- data.frame(country = c("US", "UK", "CA", "FR", "IT"),
                  pop = c(327, 66, 37, 67, 60))
print(df1)
order(df1$pop, decreasing = TRUE)
top3 <- order(df1$pop, decreasing = TRUE)[1:3]
df1[top3, ]
```

# Workflow in \texttt{R}
- Usual workflow for data anlaysis [@grolemund_r_2016]:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width='85%', fig.align='center'}
#knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/ak915/git/MethodRA/data-science-explore.png")
knitr::include_graphics("data-science-explore.png")
```

# Tidyverse and tidy data
- \texttt{Tidyverse} is a collection of packages designed for data science with unified grammar and data structures

- *Tidy data*:
  - Each **variable** must have its own **column**
  - Each **observation** must have its own **row**
  - Each value must have its own cell

# Tidyverse and tidy data
>- To install \texttt{Tidyverse} package, run: 

\small
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

>- To load a package, run (usually at the top of your R document): 

\small
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

# Importing data in \texttt{R}

\small
```{r, message=F, warning=F}
# Load package
library(tidyverse)
```

\small
```{r}
# Load econ.csv
econ <- read_csv("http://staff.washington.edu/kpleung/vis/data/econ.csv")

# tibble (tbl) is a special class of data frame
class(econ)
```

# Importing data in \texttt{R}
\scriptsize
```{r}
# Get a sense of the dataset
glimpse(econ)

head(econ)
```

# Basic data wrangling
- Below are just scratching the surface; check out
  - \href{https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-the-tidyverse}{Introductory course to tidyverse at DataCamp}
  - \href{https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-transformation.pdf}{Cheat sheet for data wrangling} 
  - \href{https://r4ds.had.co.nz}{\textit{R for Data Science}}

# Basic data wrangling: `count()`
Count number of rows in each group:
\scriptsize
```{r}
econ %>%
  count(country)
```

# Basic data wrangling: `%>%`
>- What is `%>%` ("pipe")?
>    - `x %>% fun(y)` is equivalent to `fun(x, y)`
>    - Its advantage will be apparent when you perform numerous steps of manipulation

\scriptsize
```{r}
count(econ, country) # Equivalent to econ %>% count(country)
```

# Basic data wrangling: `arrange()`
Order rows by values of column(s) from low to high:
\scriptsize
```{r}
econ %>%
  count(country) %>%
  arrange(n) # Rather than: arrange(count(econ, country), n)
```

# Basic data wrangling: `arrange()`
Order rows by values of column(s) from high to low:
\scriptsize
```{r}
econ %>%
  count(country) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

# Basic data wrangling: `filter()`
Extract rows that meet logical criteria:

\scriptsize
```{r}
econ %>%
  filter(country == "Brazil")
```

# Basic data wrangling: `filter()`
Extract rows that meet **multiple** logical criteria:
\scriptsize
```{r}
econ %>%
  filter(
    country == "Brazil" | country == "Russia (Soviet Union)" | 
    country == "India"  | country == "China"
  )
```

# Basic data wrangling: `filter()`
Alternatively: 
\scriptsize
```{r}
econ %>%
  filter(country %in% c("Brazil", "Russia (Soviet Union)", "India", "China"))
```

# Basic data wrangling: `select()`
Extract columns (variables):

\scriptsize
```{r}
econ %>%
  select(country, year, gdpPercap)
```

# Basic data wrangling: `filter()` & `select()`

Filter USA observations from 2000 to 2010 with `year` and `gdpPercap` as the only variables:

\scriptsize
```{r}
USAdata <- econ %>%
  filter(country == "United States of America",
         year %in% 2000:2010) %>%
  select(year, gdpPercap)

print(USAdata)
```

# Basic data wrangling: `summarize()`
Compute table of summaries: 
\small
```{r}
USAdata %>%
  summarize(avg_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap))
```
What if we want to calculate the average GDP per capita for all countries in our data set?

# Basic data wrangling: `group_by()` & `summarize()`
>- Create a grouped version of the table with `group_by()`
>    - Subsequent functions will manipulate each group *separately*
    
\scriptsize
```{r}
econ %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(avg_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap)) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_gdpPercap))
```

# Basic data wrangling: more `summarize()`
What if we want to know the numbers of distinct countries and years in the data set?
\small
```{r}
econ %>%
  summarize_at(c("country", "year"), n_distinct)
```

# Basic data wrangling: `mutate()`
Compute new columns (variables): 
\scriptsize
```{r}
econ %>%
  mutate(
    id = row_number(),
    decade = year %/% 10 * 10
  ) %>%
  select(id, country, GWn, year, decade, gdpPercap)
```

# Basic data wrangling: `group_by()` & `summarize()`
What if we want to know countries' average GDP per capita over decades? 
\scriptsize
```{r}
econ %>%
  mutate(decade = year %/% 10 * 10) %>%
  group_by(country, decade) %>%
  summarize(decAvg_gdp = mean(gdpPercap))
```

# Saving wrangled data

When you save the wrangled data, don't overwrite the original data with the same file name:

\small
```{r, eval = FALSE}
write_csv(econ, "econ_wrangled.csv")
```

# Intermediate data wranggling: second data set
```{r, include = F}
options(width=150)
```

\scriptsize
```{r, message=F}
pop <- read_csv("http://staff.washington.edu/kpleung/vis/data/pop.csv")
head(pop)
# Compare with econ
head(econ)
```

# Intermediate data wranggling: `join` family
How do we combine two data sets such that:
\scriptsize
```{r,echo=FALSE}
econ %>%
  left_join(pop, by = c("GWn", "year")) %>%
  select(-country.y) %>%
  rename(country = country.x)
```

# Intermediate data wranggling: `join` family
Family of `join` functions: `inner_join`, `left_join`, `right_join`, `full_join`...

\scriptsize
```{r}
data <- econ %>%
  left_join(pop, by = c("GWn", "year")) %>%
  select(-country.y) %>%
  rename(country = country.x)
```

\scriptsize
```{r, echo = F}
print(data)
```

# Intermediate data wranggling: `separate` (or `Regex`) 

How to separate the `region` column into `continent` and `sub_region`?

\scriptsize
```{r, echo = F}
data %>%
  separate(region, into = c("continent", "sub_region"), sep = ": ")
```

# Intermediate data wranggling: `separate` (or `Regex`)

How to separate the `region` column into `continent` and `sub_region`?

\scriptsize
```{r}
data %>%
  separate(region, into = c("continent", "sub_region"), sep = ": ")
```

# Intermediate data wranggling: `separate` (or `Regex`)

How to separate the `region` column into `continent` and `sub_region`?

\scriptsize
```{r}
# Or using regular expression
data %>%
  mutate(continent = str_extract(region, ".*(?=: )"),
         sub_region = str_extract(region, "(?<=: ).*")) %>%
  select(-region)
```

```{r, include=F}
data <- data %>%
  separate(region, into = c("continent", "sub_region"), sep = ": ")
```

# Intermediate data wranggling: `case_when`

- How to convert `pop` into a new categorical variable, called `popCat`:
  - Countries with `pop` value lower than the first quartile of all `pop` is classified as "low"
  - Countries with `pop` value equal to or higher than the first quartile, but lower than the third quartile is classified as "middle"
  - Countries with `pop` value equal to or higher than the third quartile is classified as "high"
  
# Intermediate data wranggling: `case_when`
\scriptsize
```{r}
Qts <- quantile(data$pop, prob = c(0.25, 0.75), na.rm = TRUE)
print(Qts)

Q1 <- Qts[1]
Q3 <- Qts[2]

data <- data %>%
  mutate(popCat = case_when(pop < Q1 ~ "low",
                            pop >= Q1 & pop < Q3 ~ "middle",
                            pop > Q3 ~ "high")) 
```

\tiny
```{r, echo = F}
print(data)
```

# Intermediate data wranggling: `mutate` and `lag`
Focus on USA data again. How to create a variable, named `growth`, thats computes the percentage change in `gdpPercap` compared to the immediate last year? 

\scriptsize
```{r, echo = F}
data %>%
  filter(country == "United States of America") %>%
  mutate(gdpPercap_lag = lag(gdpPercap),
         growth = (gdpPercap - gdpPercap_lag) / gdpPercap_lag) %>%
  select(country, year, gdpPercap, growth)
```

# Intermediate data wranggling: `mutate` and `lag`
\scriptsize
```{r}
# Extract USA data
USAdata <- data %>%
  filter(country == "United States of America") %>%
  select(country, year, gdpPercap)

# Use `lag` to create a column of gdpPercap in past year
USAdata <- USAdata %>%
  mutate(gdpPercap_lag1 = lag(gdpPercap, n = 1))

print(USAdata)
```

# Intermediate data wranggling: `mutate` and `lag`
\scriptsize
```{r}
